# Login Page with HTML, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome

## What is this project?

This project is a **login page** that you can use as a template or example. It is built using three main technologies:

- **HTML**: This creates the structure of the page (the form and layout).
- **Bootstrap**: A framework that makes the page look good on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile) without needing to write a lot of custom CSS.
- **Font Awesome**: A set of icons to add some visual appeal (for example, a lock icon next to the password field).

The page has a simple login form with fields for:
- Username/Email
- Password
- A Submit button

The form is **responsive**, which means it looks great no matter the size of the screen you're using.

## Why use this?

You can use this as a **starting point** if you want a clean and functional login page for your website or project. It saves time by using Bootstrap for layout and Font Awesome for icons. It’s easy to customize if you want to add more features or adjust the style.


## What's inside the code?

- **HTML** creates the basic layout.
- **Bootstrap** is used for styling and responsiveness, so the page looks great on any device.
- **Font Awesome** adds some cool icons to the buttons and form fields.
